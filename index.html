    Using Computer Vision for markerless motion capture has been an interest of computer scientists for many years.  While full-body motion capture is usually the focus, the same principles discussed here can be applied to capturing the motion of a person’s hands, for the purpose of gesture recognition in American Sign Language contexts.  In markerless motion capture, one can identify critical elements that make up the body, or part of the body, and use those elements to reconstruct a 3D “skeleton”, onto which the motions of the subject are mapped.  The end result is a 3D recording of the movements of the subject’s movements, which can be analyzed later depending on the application.
