    <p class="tab">
Pose estimation and motion capture are one of the most popular fields in Computer Vision Currently.  Examples of current work is determining 3D joint constraints using computer vision (by Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz) and monocular posing of the body using 3D total motion with CNN (Carnegie Mellon University).  Stanford also has patents on markerless motion capture systems pending.
    </p>
    
    <p class="tab">
    There are many companies offering markerless motion capture utilities, from DARI motion's full body capture utilities to Faceshift's face motion capture.  The motion has been towards making the technologies cheaper and more easily accessible, since the algorithms already perform well under controlled settings (which require funding).  Pose estimation also has a greater scope in applications such as identification of intent, which fall outside of the realm of motion tracking/capture.

    <p>Finally, our group in the Computer Vision class will be applying the principles of motion capture to gesture recognition; by recording the movement of the hand, one can analyze it later to determine what movement means.</p>
